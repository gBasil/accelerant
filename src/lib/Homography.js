     * Summary.           Class for performing geometrical transformations over images.
     * 
     * Description.       Homography is in charge of performing: Affine, Projective or PiecewiseAffine transformations over images,
     *                    in a way that is as transparent and simple to the user as possible. It is lightweight and specially intended
     *                    for real-time applications. For this purpose, this class keeps an internal state for avoiding redundant operations
     *                    when reused, therefore, critical performance comes when multiple transformations are done over the same image.

     *  
     * @param {Transform} [transform = "auto"]  String representing the transformation to be done. One of "auto", "affine", "piecewiseaffine" or "projective":
     *                                           · "auto" : Transformation will be automatically selected depending on the inputs given. Just take "auto" if you
     *                                                      don't know which kind of transform do you need. This is the default value.
     * 
     *                                           · "affine" : A geometrical transformation that ensures that all parallel lines of the input image will be parallel
     *                                                        in the output image. It will need exactly three source points to be set (and three destiny points). 
     *                                                        An affine transformation can only be composed by rotations, scales, shearings and reflections.
     * 
     *                                           · "piecewiseaffine" : A composition of several affine transforms that allows more complex constructions. This transforms

     *                                                                 for each one of them. This way, it allows more complex transformation as, for example, sinusoidal forms.
     *                                                                 It can take any amount (greater than three) of reference points. When "piecewiseaffine" mode is selected,

     *  
     *                                            · "projective" : A transformation that shows how the an image change when the point of view of the observer is modified. 
     *                                                             It takes exactly four source points (and four destiny points). This is the transformation that should

     * 
     * @param {Number}              [width]     Optional width of the input image. If given, it will resize the input image to that width. Lower widths will imply faster
     *                                          transformations at the cost of lower resolution in the output image, while larger widths will produce higher resolution images
